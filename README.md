# Shopping Cart by Vector in Assembly

Welcome to the Shopping Cart by Vector in Assembly project! This project demonstrates how to implement a shopping cart system using assembly language with vector operations. It showcases fundamental programming techniques and data structures in a low-level language.

## Project Overview

The Shopping Cart by Vector in Assembly project aims to create a simple shopping cart system using assembly language. It illustrates how to manage a list of items, handle user inputs, and perform operations like adding items to the cart and displaying the cart contents.

## Features

- **Item Management**: Add and remove items from the shopping cart.
- **Display Cart**: View the contents of the cart.
- **Basic Operations**: Perform basic operations such as adding items, removing items, and updating quantities.

## Key Components

### Assembly Code

- **Main Program**: Contains the entry point and main loop of the shopping cart system.
- **Item Management**: Functions for adding, removing, and updating items in the cart.
- **Display Functions**: Procedures to display the contents of the cart.

### Data Structures

- **Vector**: Used to store items in the cart, with operations for adding and removing items.
- **Item Structure**: Defines the properties of each item, such as ID, name, and quantity.

## Installation
